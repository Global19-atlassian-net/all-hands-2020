# Elibility

In general, we intend to the event to be open to people who are
actively participating in the Rust organization. In some cases, that's
a bit hard to define precisely.

## Team members and working group participants

Our intent is that the event is open to active participants in the
Rust organization. This includes both teams and working
groups. However, in many cases it can be somewhat hard to define who
is an "active participant". Therefore, we leave some of the judgement
calls up to the leads of the relevant group.

Our official rule is that **all team members** are invited as well as
**working group leads**.  Beyond that, team leads and working group
leads can opt to make additional invitations as appropriate.
Leads can contact <rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org> with
questions about how to do so.

Anyone actively involved in the Rust organization is eligible for
sponsorship of both travel and the ticket price. See the [ticket
page](./tickets.html) for more detail.

## Other folks

In addition, we sometimes extend invitations to additional folks who
have specific things to discuss with team members. This might include
researchers working on an interesting proposal or production users
looking to build involvement with the Rust organization.

**People not actively involved in the Rust organization are not automatically
eligible for sponsorship, however.**

If you are interested in attending, but not sure if you qualify, or
would like to discuss sponsorship, please send an e-mail to
<rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org>.
