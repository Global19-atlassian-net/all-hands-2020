# Welcome

Welcome to the webpage for the Rust All Hands 2020! This site should
contain all the information you need about the event.

## What is the Rust All Hands?

The Rust All Hands is an annual event where Rust team members and
other people actively involved in the Rust community get together for
high-bandwidth work. It offers us a chance to push on designs, look at
tricky implementation problems, and to make plans for the remainder of
the year. The details of how each Rust team or working group makes use
of the All Hands will vary, but that's the idea.

## When and where is the Rust All Hands?

This year the all hands event for 2020 has been cancelled, we're currently
figuring out when to have the next event.

## Am I eligible to attend?

The Rust All Hands is an invitation-only event, but we do try to take an
inclusive stance on who can attend. Check out the [eligibility] web
page for details on that.
