<h2 id="who-is-eligible-to-attend-the-all-hands">Who is eligible to attend the All Hands?</h2>

<p>Invitations are extended to all team members and WG leads. Each lead can make additional invitations as appropriate for that team or working group (leads can contact <a href="mailto:rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org">rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org</a> with questions about how to do so). In addition, we sometimes extend invitations to additional folks who have specific things to discuss with team members. If you are interested in attending, but not sure if you qualify, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org">rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="can-any-company-purchase-a-sponsorship-ticket">Can any company purchase a sponsorship ticket?</h2>

<p>All tickets — including sponsorship tickets — are only available for purchase to folks elegible to attend the All Hands anyway (see the previous question). Sponsors should reach out to <a href="mailto:rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org">rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org</a> before purchasing tickets as well.</p>

<h2 id="does-the-sponsorship-ticket-include-entrance-to-the-event">Does the sponsorship ticket include entrance to the event?</h2>

<p>Yes, all tickets cover entrance for one person. The price of the more expensive tickets is then used to sponsor folks who would otherwise not be able to attend.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-feel-bad-about-asking-for-a-sponsored-ticket-or-flight">Should I feel bad about asking for a sponsored ticket or flight?</h2>

<p>Absolutely not! We want all team members to attend. The tickets are there to help us conveniently raise money, not to keep people out.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-the-prices-come-from-will-there-be-profits-and-what-happens-to-them">Where do the prices come from? Will there be profits and what happens to them?</h2>

<p>These prices have been chosen to cover the cost of the event and nothing more. Any profits will be saved and put to use for future Rust All Hands or other Rust programs and events.</p>

<h2 id="why-use-tickets-in-particular">Why use tickets in particular?</h2>

<p>We considered various forms of sponsorship, but for many folks tickets are the most convenient in terms of corporate procedure. They can be “expensed” along with flights and don’t require special approval or involve more parts of the company (unlike, say, sponsoring a conference).</p>

<h2 id="why-the-change-in-location">Why the change in location?</h2>

<p>Previous Rust All Hands took place at the Mozilla Offices in
Berlin. We had to change locations because we were outgrowing that
space. We looked for a European location because much of the Rust
community is located in Europe. The University of Macedonia was chosen
from amongst a few other candidates.</p>
