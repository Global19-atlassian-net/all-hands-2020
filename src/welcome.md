# Welcome

Welcome to the webpage for the Rust All Hands 2020! This site should
contain all the information you need about the event.

## WARNING

As of this moment, all the material on this site is a **work in
progess**. We should be opening it up for public consumption soon!

## What is the Rust All Hands?

The Rust All Hands is an annual event where Rust team members and
other people actively involved in the Rust community get together for
high-bandwidth work. It offers us a chance to push on designs, look at
tricky implementation problems, and to make plans for the remainder of
the year. The details of how each Rust team or working group makes use
of the All Hands will vary, but that's the idea.
