Title: ###: Save The Date

Dear Rustaceans,

our next **open space** style Meetup will be on **Wednesday YYYY-MM-DD, 19:15 CET**.

Imagine a bazaar, where you can suggest topics and spontaneously join any discussion you find interesting. It all depends on your interests. You can enjoy some drinks, meet nice people and discuss about Rust.

**[You can register here](...)**.

We are looking forward to seeing you. :-)

Yours,
CHANGEME
