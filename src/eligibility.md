# Elibility

In general, we intend to the event to be open to people who are
actively participating in the Rust organization. In some cases, that's
a bit hard to define precisely.

Invitations are extended to all team members and WG leads. Each lead
can make additional invitations as appropriate for that team or
working group (leads can contact <rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org> with
questions about how to do so). In addition, we sometimes extend
invitations to additional folks who have specific things to discuss
with team members. If you are interested in attending, but not sure if
you qualify, please send an e-mail to <rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org>.
