<p>Welcome to the webpage for the Rust All Hands 2020! This site should
contain all the information you need about the event.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-rust-all-hands" id="what-is-the-rust-all-hands">What is the Rust All Hands?</a></h2>
<p>The Rust All Hands is an annual event where Rust team members and
other people actively involved in the Rust community get together for
high-bandwidth work. It offers us a chance to push on designs, look at
tricky implementation problems, and to make plans for the remainder of
the year. The details of how each Rust team or working group makes use
of the All Hands will vary, but that's the idea.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#when-and-where-is-the-rust-all-hands" id="when-and-where-is-the-rust-all-hands">When and where is the Rust All Hands?</a></h2>
<p>This year the all hands event for 2020 has been cancelled, we're currently
figuring out when to have the next event.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#am-i-eligible-to-attend" id="am-i-eligible-to-attend">Am I eligible to attend?</a></h2>
<p>The Rust All Hands is an invitation-only event, but we do try to take an
inclusive stance on who can attend. Check out the <a href="./eligibility.html">eligibility</a> web
page for details on that.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#more-questions" id="more-questions">More questions?</a></h2>
<p>Check out the <a href="./faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page for
further information.</p>
<h1><a class="header" href="#eligibility" id="eligibility">Eligibility</a></h1>
<p>In general, we intend the event to be open to people who are
actively participating in the Rust organization. In some cases, that's
a bit hard to define precisely.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#inclusiveness" id="inclusiveness">Inclusiveness</a></h2>
<p>It is our intention for the All Hands to be an inclusive event. We
would like in particular that every contributor should be able to
attend, independent of their financial and social status. For this
reason, we will provide sponsorship as well as support remote
participation.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#team-members-and-working-group-participants" id="team-members-and-working-group-participants">Team members and working group participants</a></h2>
<p>Our intent is that the event is open to active participants in the
Rust organization. This includes both teams and working
groups. However, in many cases it can be somewhat hard to define who
is an &quot;active participant&quot;. Therefore, we leave some of the judgement
calls up to the leads of the relevant group.</p>
<p>Our official rule is that <strong>all team members</strong> are invited as well as
<strong>working group leads</strong>.  Beyond that, team leads and working group
leads can opt to make additional invitations as appropriate.
Leads can contact <a href="mailto:rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org">rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org</a> with
questions about how to do so.</p>
<p>Anyone actively involved in the Rust organization is eligible for
sponsorship to cover the travel and ticket prices. See the <a href="./tickets.html">ticket
page</a> for more details.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#other-folks" id="other-folks">Other folks</a></h2>
<p>In addition, we sometimes extend invitations to additional folks who
have specific things to discuss with team members. We may include
people who live in the area where the All Hands is taking place,
researchers working on an interesting proposal, or production users
looking to build involvement with the Rust organization.</p>
<p><strong>People not actively involved in the Rust organization are not automatically
eligible for sponsorship, however.</strong></p>
<p>If you are interested in attending, but not sure if you qualify, or
would like to discuss sponsorship, please send an e-mail to
<a href="mailto:rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org">rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#remote-access" id="remote-access">Remote access</a></h2>
<p>If you are interested in participating in a particular meeting, but
are not able to attend the event in person, please let team leads and
organizers know and we will make a best effort to enable remote
participation.</p>

<h2><a class="header" href="#who-is-eligible-to-attend-the-all-hands" id="who-is-eligible-to-attend-the-all-hands">Who is eligible to attend the All Hands?</a></h2>
<p>See the <a href="./eligibility.html">Eligibility</a> page for all the details.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#i-am-eligible-to-attend-the-event-what-should-i-be-doing" id="i-am-eligible-to-attend-the-event-what-should-i-be-doing">I am eligible to attend the event. What should I be doing?</a></h2>
<p>Presuming you are eligible to attend the event, you should be
following the steps listed in the <a href="./registration.html">Registration</a> page.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#can-any-company-purchase-a-sponsorship-ticket" id="can-any-company-purchase-a-sponsorship-ticket">Can any company purchase a sponsorship ticket?</a></h2>
<p>All tickets — including sponsorship tickets — are only available for purchase to folks eligible to attend the All Hands anyway (see the previous question). Sponsors should reach out to <a href="mailto:rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org">rust-all-hands@rust-lang.org</a> before purchasing tickets as well.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#does-the-sponsorship-ticket-include-entrance-to-the-event" id="does-the-sponsorship-ticket-include-entrance-to-the-event">Does the sponsorship ticket include entrance to the event?</a></h2>
<p>Yes, all tickets cover entrance for one person. The price of the more expensive tickets is then used to sponsor folks who would otherwise not be able to attend.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#should-i-feel-bad-about-asking-for-a-sponsored-ticket-or-flight" id="should-i-feel-bad-about-asking-for-a-sponsored-ticket-or-flight">Should I feel bad about asking for a sponsored ticket or flight?</a></h2>
<p>Absolutely not! We want all team members to attend. The tickets are there to help us conveniently raise money, not to keep people out.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#where-do-the-prices-come-from-will-there-be-profits-and-what-happens-to-them" id="where-do-the-prices-come-from-will-there-be-profits-and-what-happens-to-them">Where do the prices come from? Will there be profits and what happens to them?</a></h2>
<p>These prices have been chosen to cover the cost of the event and nothing more. Any profits will be saved and put to use for future Rust All Hands or other Rust programs and events.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-use-tickets-in-particular" id="why-use-tickets-in-particular">Why use tickets in particular?</a></h2>
<p>We considered various forms of sponsorship, but for many folks tickets are the most convenient in terms of corporate procedure. They can be “expensed” along with flights and don’t require special approval or involve more parts of the company (unlike, say, sponsoring a conference).</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#why-the-change-in-location" id="why-the-change-in-location">Why the change in location?</a></h2>
<p>Previous Rust All Hands took place at the Mozilla Offices in
Berlin. We had to change locations because we were outgrowing that
space. We looked for a European location because much of the Rust
community is located in Europe. The University of Macedonia was chosen
from amongst a few other candidates.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#where-can-i-address-other-questions" id="where-can-i-address-other-questions">Where can I address other questions?</a></h2>
